# Dice-Game
In this Project I have Created a Dice Game.
There are Two Players In this Game.
Each Player Has a Dice with Contain 6 Faces.
On Refreshing the page, The dice will roll and shows a Unique Face.
If Player 1 has a dice Face which contains Bigger Number from the Player 2 Dice, than "Player 1 Wins".
Similarly,If Player 2 has a dice Face which contains Bigger Number from the Player 1 Dice, than "Player 1 Wins".
If Both Players gets the same numbers on Dice, than it's "DRAW".
Keep Refreshing the page to Play the Game again and again.
